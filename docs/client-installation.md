# Starfell Client Installation Guide
This guide will provide instructions for installing and setting up the Starfell modpack on your minecraft client.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with installation of the modpack on your local machine, you will first need the following components (if you already did this, continue on to the [Mod Pack Installation](./client-installation.md#modpack-installation) section):
```
Java JRE 17+
Minecraft 1.16 (LATEST)
```

### _Java_
#### **Setting up Sumeru**
The recommended Java version to install is IBM Sumeru from IBM's developer website, but in theory any flavor of Java 17 should work with this modpack (though only Sumeru will be tested with this modpack and modded server). To install the IBM Sumeru Runtime, navigate to [this page](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/), download the latest `Java 17.x.x.x LTS` version applicable to your OS and run the installer, following the default settings during the installation process.

_Installation on the IBM Semeru website can be confusing at first, since there are so many variations of Java 17 from IBM for different operating systems. In the event of installation on windows, the link to download the installer is the blue "msi" text on the right-most column._

#### **Verifying the Installatrion**
Once Java is installed, open a command prompt or terminal (depending on your OS) and run the command: `java -version`. If it is installed correctly you should see the following response:
```log
PS C:\Users\<username>> java -version
openjdk version "17.0.5" 2022-10-18
IBM Semeru Runtime Open Edition 17.0.5.0 (build 17.0.5+8)
Eclipse OpenJ9 VM 17.0.5.0 (build openj9-0.35.0, JRE 17 Windows 11 amd64-64-Bit Compressed References 20221018_298 (JIT enabled, AOT enabled)
OpenJ9   - e04a7f6c1
OMR      - 85a21674f
JCL      - 32d2c409a33 based on jdk-17.0.5+8)
```

### _Minecraft_
Installing an earlier version of minecraft is a pretty trivial process, which can be done entirely within the minecraft launcher. Installing the correct vanilla version of minecraft is important, as it ensures the necessary minecraft runtimes are downloaded for the base of the modpack.
